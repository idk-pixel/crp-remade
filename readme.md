# CRP Remade by WhoAboutYT

## _What motivated me to make this/Why did I make this?_

Well as of 11/9/2022, CRP (Controlled Roleplay Solutions) is going to shut down. I want to re-make CRP as an open source bot so people can run this locally and still run their servers.

## _How do you use this?_

_More info coming soon._

### _Dependencies_

discord.js v14.6.0
